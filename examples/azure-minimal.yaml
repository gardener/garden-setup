# This is an example for a minimal configuration for Azure.
# Backup blob store and DNS will be defaulted, this means
#   1. Azure blob storage will be used for etcd backups
#   2. Azure DNS will be used for DNS
#   3. Your Azure account needs to be able to manage the provided domain. It is recommended to specify a subdomain of the managed domain in 'landscape.domain',
#      so if your domain managed in Azure is 'foo.bar.com', you should enter 'landscape.foo.bar.com' in this domain field.
#   4. The credentials provided for Azure need to have the necessary permissions for blob store and DNS management (in addition to the ones needed for Gardener).
#   5. You need to provide a name for the resource group where the blob storage should be created in. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
