# This is an example for a minimal configuration for AWS.
# Backup blob store and DNS will be defaulted, this means
#   1. AWS blob storage will be used for etcd backups
#   2. AWS route53 will be used for DNS
#   3. Your AWS account needs to be able to manage the provided domain. It is recommended to specify a subdomain of the managed domain in 'landscape.domain',
#      so if your domain managed in route53 is 'foo.bar.com', you should enter 'landscape.foo.bar.com' in this domain field.
#   4. The credentials provided for AWS need to have the necessary permissions for blob store and DNS management (in addition to the ones needed for Gardener).
