# This file can be used to transform an old acre.yaml (before release 1.0.0) to a new acre.yaml.
# Requirements: spiff++ v1.3.0 -> https://github.com/mandelsoft/spiff/releases/tag/v1.3.0
# Usage:
#   1. Rename your acre.yaml to acre_old.yaml (so you don't lose it in case something fails)
#   2. Execute the command 'spiff merge ./merge_acre.yaml ../acre_old.yaml > ../acre.yaml' from within your 'crop' folder
